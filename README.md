## Magic: The Gathering Deck-Builds (Unofficial)

MAGIC: THE GATHERING was released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast as a Trading Card Game but was later
acquired by Hasbro in 1999, where it remains as one of the top selling brands till present. MTG also have
a digital presence in the game industry across the years and the most recent title is "MTG Arena". 

To play the physical card game, players have to purchase cards from different Edition sets like Mirage, 
Fallen Empires, Phyrexia, March of the Machine and so on. Once each player has acquired the necessary cards,
they have to build a deck that holds a minimal of 60 cards. With that, they can use the deck to compete against
another player or a group of players.

Not all cards can be easily attain when going through the deck building experience. Therefore, players have 
to plan, search, trade or purchase cards from other collectors or players to make their deck. This part of the
deck building journey is an expensive one due to the rarity of certain cards.


## Reasons to develop this application

I used to play MTG from 1994 to 1998 and stopped due to the huge cost of building decks. Despite of that,
I enjoyed looking at all the different artworks on the cards that were made across the years.

Therefore, with the available MTG APIs, I have decided to make this application for players to source for cards and use it to build decks, build combo methods and save it into a list where they can go back and refer at anytime. In addition, I wanna help players to spend their money wisely before purchasing the card(s) they need for their deck building experience.
